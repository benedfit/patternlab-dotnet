## About Pattern Lab .NET

The .NET version of Pattern Lab is an MVC wrapper for the core Pattern Lab files.

## Under Active Development

## Getting Started

For now you can clone the repo and open the solution in Visual Studio, or point IIS at /PatternLab.Source to get up and running. But once v0.7.12 is released a Nuget package will be made available for easy installation.
