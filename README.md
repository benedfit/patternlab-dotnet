## About the .NET Version of Pattern Lab

The .NET version of Pattern Lab is an MVC 4 wrapper for the Core files found in the PHP version.

## Under Active Development

The .NET version of Pattern Lab is under active development by [@benedfit](https://twitter.com/benedfit). It's currently based on version 0.7.12 of the PHP version, and drifts in and out of working with each commit. Contributions are very welcome!

FYI, the .NET version isn't currently a static site generator, and relies in MVC 4 to be viewed. I will be putting a static output generator back in once everything in the MVP is up and running.

### Getting Started

This will involve a nuget package, but you'll know more when I know.

#### Roadmap
* Make it do all the things the PHP version (0.7.12) can
* Documentation for .NET changes
* Tests
