## About the .NET Version of Pattern Lab

The .NET version of Pattern Lab is, at its core, currently a copy of the PHP one, but I'll get there.

## Under Active Development

The .NET version of Pattern Lab is in stalled development by [@benedfit](https://twitter.com/benedfit), and is behind the PHP versions. Contributions very welcome.

### Getting Started

You'll know when I know.

#### Roadmap
* Full Patternlab site support.  (This is the uber cool navigation found at [demo.pattern-lab.info](http://demo.pattern-lab.info)).
* More Documentation
* Tests

**THE FOLLOWING IS FROM THE PATTERNLAB-PHP PROJECT.  A LOT STILL APPLIES TO PATTERNLAB-DOTNET, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN ADAPTED YET.  USE AT YOUR OWN PERIL**
