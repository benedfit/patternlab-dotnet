## About Pattern Lab .NET

The .NET version of Pattern Lab is an MVC wrapper for the core files found in the [PHP version](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php).

## Under Active Development

The .NET version of Pattern Lab is under active development by [@benedfit](https://twitter.com/benedfit).

## Getting Started

For now you can clone the repo and open the solution in Visual Studio, or point IIS at /PatternLab.Source to get up and running. But once v0.7.12 is released a Nuget package will be made available for easy installation.

## To-do

* Make it do all the things the PHP version (v0.7.12) can. [A list of outstanding development tasks can be viewed here](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-net/issues?labels=v0.7.12&page=1&state=open).
* Documentation for .NET changes and installation
* Comprehensive code documentation
* Tests
