## About the .NET Version of Pattern Lab

The .NET version of Pattern Lab is, at its core, currently a copy of the PHP one, but I'll get there.

## Under Active Development

The .NET version of Pattern Lab is under active development by [@benedfit](https://twitter.com/benedfit). It's currently behind the PHP version and not yet actually working. Contributions are very welcome!

FYI, the .NET version has strayed from the static site generator roots of the PHP version currently, and uses MVC to render everything. I will be putting a static output generator back in once everything is up and running

### Getting Started

You'll know when I know.

#### Roadmap
* Make it do all the things the PHP version (0.7.12) can
* Documentation for .NET changes
* Tests

## Demo

You can play with a demo of the front-end of the PHP version of Pattern Lab at [demo.patternlab.io](http://demo.patternlab.io/).
