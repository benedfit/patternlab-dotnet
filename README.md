## About Pattern Lab .NET

The .NET version of Pattern Lab is an MVC 4 wrapper for the core files found in the [PHP version](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php).

## Under Active Development

The .NET version of Pattern Lab is under active development by [@benedfit](https://twitter.com/benedfit). Contributions are very welcome!

FYI, the .NET version isn't currently a static site generator, and requires a Visual Studio workflow to use. I will be putting a static output generator back in once everything is up a running, but for the meantime it requires MVC 4 to host.

## Demo

Work in progress on the .NET version of Pattern Lab can be seen at [patternlab-dotnet.apphb.com](http://patternlab-dotnet.apphb.com/).

You can play with a demo of the front-end of PHP version of Pattern Lab at [demo.patternlab.io](http://demo.patternlab.io).

## Getting Started

* This will involve installing a single nuget package, but you'll know more when I know.

## To-do

* Make it do all the things the PHP version (v0.7.12) can. [A list of outstanding development tasks can be viewed here](https://github.com/benedfit/patternlab-dotnet/issues?labels=v0.7.12&page=1&state=open).
* Documentation for .NET changes and installation
* Comprehensive code documentation
* Tests
