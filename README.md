## About Pattern Lab .NET

The .NET version of Pattern Lab is an MVC wrapper for the core Pattern Lab files.

## Under Active Development

The .NET version of Pattern Lab is under active development by [@benedfit](https://twitter.com/benedfit).

## Getting Started

If you really want to take a look you can clone the repo and open the solution in Visual Studio, or point IIS at /PatternLab to get up and running. 

But if you can hold off a little longer a Nuget package will be made available for easy installation within the next week.

## To-dos for release of v0.7.12

* Create Nuget package
* Documentation for .NET changes and installation for http://patternlab.io/
* Comprehensive code documentation
* Tests
